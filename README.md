Scalable Data Labeling System for ML Models
Project Description
This project implements a data labeling system using Python and AWS S3, designed to automate and scale the process of labeling datasets for machine learning model training. The system downloads raw data from AWS S3, labels it based on predefined rules, and uploads the labeled data back to the cloud.

Key Features:
Automated data labeling using custom rules.
Integration with AWS S3 for scalable data storage.
Python-based implementation with Pandas for data manipulation.
Jenkins pipeline for continuous integration and automation.
Requirements
Python 3.x
boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)
pandas
AWS account with S3 access
Jenkins (for CI/CD pipeline)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-data-labeling-system.git
Install required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your AWS credentials with appropriate permissions for accessing S3.
Usage
Run the data_labeling.py script to download, label, and upload data:

bash
Copy code
python data_labeling.py
Configuration
Update AWS credentials and bucket details in the data_labeling.py script.
Jenkins Pipeline
The project comes with a Jenkins pipeline configuration (Jenkinsfile) to automate the labeling process through continuous integration.
